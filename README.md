# METGen: A Multimodal Emotion Generation Framework

We  present  an  emotion-based  image  captioning pipeline developed on top of transformer architecture.  We contrast this with an RNN-based image captioning baseline. We also conduct experiments using intermediate fine tuning and back-translation. We finally developed a rigorous evaluation scheme comprising of human  evaluation, MAUVE score, & classification based evaluation. We measure all our explorations against the evaluation schemes & highlight the shortcomings both qualitatively & quantitatively.
